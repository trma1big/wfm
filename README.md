## WorkFlow Monitor

configure WF using standard BPMn diagram files - in this case a simple BPM workflow that represent a list of process/activity  - 
typical use case are :
* a workflow that contains all the backoffice process needed to "close" a day ( _example/example_BPO.bpmn )
* a workflow that contains all the AM IT department process needed to give the start to the customers to work on an application ( _example/example_IT.bpmn )

the status of each fases rappresented in bpmn diagram could be changed using the API or manually using the web interface.

no databases needed!! all configuration are saved on json files in order to be portable without problems.
